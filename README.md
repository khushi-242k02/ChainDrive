# ChainDrive
<p><strong>ChainDrive</strong> is a decentralized platform designed for secure image upload and sharing using blockchain technology. This project integrates Solidity smart contracts for access control and ownership management with IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) through Pinata for decentralized image storage. Additionally, Hardhat is used for contract deployment, and MetaMask handles transactions.</p>

<p><h3>Features:</h3></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Decentralized Storage:</strong> Images are securely uploaded to IPFS via Pinata, ensuring immutable and decentralized storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Contract:</strong> Implements Solidity smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for managing ownership and access control.</li>
    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Users can grant or revoke access to their images for specific individuals through the smart contract.</li>
</ul>

<p><h3>Technologies Used:</h3></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Solidity:</strong> For developing smart contracts that handle ownership and access rights.</li>
    <li><strong>React:</strong> For the front-end interface, enabling users to upload images and manage access settings.</li>
    <li><strong>IPFS with Pinata:</strong> Decentralized storage solution for hosting and pinning images on IPFS, ensuring long-term availability and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Hardhat:</strong> For deploying and testing smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem.</li>
    <li><strong>MetaMask:</strong> For handling transactions and interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
</ul>

<p>ChainDrive combines blockchain technology with decentralized storage to offer a robust and user-friendly solution for managing and sharing images securely.</p>
